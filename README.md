# MealPlanningWebsite

A big web development project, still somewhat under construction. But a fully fleged website, with it's own CSS and graphics, to help people with ADHD plan their meals and groceries. Comes with it's own database to keep track of logins, meals and ingredients, and such. Once you log in, you can build your own database of meals and ingredients to create meal plans and grocery lists, as well as keep track of what's in your pantry right now. At least you will once it's finished.
